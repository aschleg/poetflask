various online sources and APIs. The poetry content was extracted from [PoetryDB](http://poetrydb.org/), and the poet 
descriptions and other information is taken from Wikipedia through the 
[MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). The extracted data is stored in a Postgresql database.
